    <P class="text" >This pumpkin cheesecake is a great alternative to traditional cheesecake — especially for pumpkin pie fans! 
        A thick, creamy cheesecake base topped with a layer of spiced pumpkin cheesecake filling sits on a graham 
        cracker crust in this easy layered holiday dessert. Two flavors of cheesecake in every bite! Serve with a 
        scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</P>

    <ul>
        <li class="list">2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li class="list">½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li class="list">½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li class="list">2 large eggs</li>
        <li class="list">1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text">Pumpkin layer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="list">½ cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li class="list">½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li class="list">1 pinch ground cloves, or more to taste</li>
        <li class="list">1 pinch ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="subtittle">STEPS</h2>

    <ol>
        <li class="list">Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li class="list">Make cheesecake layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer 
            until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition. 
            Spread 1 cup batter in the graham cracker crust.</li>
        <li class="list">Make pumpkin layer: Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the remaining batter; 
            stir gently until well blended. Carefully spread on top of plain cheesecake batter in the crust.</li>
        <li class="list">Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are puffed and the surface is firm except for a small spot 
            in the center that jiggled when the pan is gently shaken, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li class="list">Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li class="list">Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, preferably overnight.</li>
    </ol>
